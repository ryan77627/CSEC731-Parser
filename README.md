# CSEC-731 HTTP Server project

This has been tested on Linux, I make no guarantees for Windows.
This can run on the latest Ubuntu LTS (22.04 at the time of writing)

To run, simply run `python -m http_server` in the root of the project (this directory!)

When asked for a test file, you can input "test_get_request.txt" or any other file on your system. If using another file, you can use a relative or absolute path.
